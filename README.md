Nature Hack 2015, yo!

Creating a visual representation of the organisms register.

## Visual
Using JS and JQuery to create visual interface.

## API
Checking out Landcare APIs to see what info we can get, what format it's in, how we can manipulate it to work with our project.

## Scraping / Wiki API
Can we scrape more information/pictures from Wikipedia/the internet to add to our project, and do this on an as-needed basis.

###Guy from Landcare Research says we gotta do these things:

1) Commercial value - Landcare needs to make commercial value out of these projects.

2) Economic value - how do you benefit NZ generally by making use of these data sets for economic value.

3) Biological heritage - how do we maintain NZs biological heritage and biodiversity because we are a biodiversity hotspot, in an environment where the economical value can be maintained.
