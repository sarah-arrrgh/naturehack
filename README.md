Nature Hack 2015, yo!

Creating a visual representation of the organisms register.

## Visual
Using JS and JQuery to create visual interface.

## API
Checking out Landcare APIs to see what info we can get, what format it's in, how we can manipulate it to work with our project.

## Scraping / Wiki API
Can we scrape more information/pictures from Wikipedia/the internet to add to our project, and do this on an as-needed basis.
