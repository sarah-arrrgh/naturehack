  "description": "NZOR is an actively maintained compilation of all organism names relevant to New Zealand: indigenous, endemic or exotic species or species not present in New Zealand but of national interest. NZOR is digitally and automatically assembled on a regular basis from a number of taxonomic data providers. It provides a consensus opinion on the preferred name for an organism, any alternative scientific names (synonyms), common and Māori names, relevant literature, and the data provider’s view on the documented presence/absence in New Zealand.

The NZOR information infrastructure is currently hosted by Landcare Research.

The development of the NZOR infrastructure was supported by the Terrestrial and Freshwater Biodiversity Information Systems Programme (TFBIS). ",
