Double-gilled mayfly without spines (S7-9)

There are lots of different types of mayflies that live in stony streams. One of the common types is Austroclima, one of the "double-gilled" group. The term double-gilled refers to the paired gills attached to the sides of the abdomen. Unlike some mayflies, Austroclima does not have strong spines along the sides of the abdomen. The low-lying body is designed to sit flat on stone surfaces in fast-flowing water, and they can be hard to see if they are not moving. If placed in a white tray in a bit of water, the three long tails can be seen.

Austroclima is quite fussy about water quality and you are unlikely to find them in waters that warm up to more than 20 degrees Celsius. This mayfly grazes on thin films of algae on stony surfaces, but it does not cope well with streambeds that are overloaded with nutrients and heavily smothered by algae.
